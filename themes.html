                    <p class="secondary-dark text-center">Samantha was a software engineer who spent most of her days staring at her computer screen. She loved her job, but her eyes often felt strained and tired after a long day of coding. One day, she decided to take a break and go for a walk outside.

                      As she strolled through the park, she noticed a group of children playing with a toy that looked like a toggle button. They were having a blast, pressing the button back and forth to make the toy light up and play music.
                      
                      Samantha couldn't help but smile at the sight. She realized that, just like the toggle button on the toy, she needed to take breaks and toggle between work and play to avoid burning out.
                      
                      With that realization, Samantha returned to her desk and added a toggle button to her website. Now, whenever she started to feel overwhelmed, she would press the button and take a quick break to recharge her batteries.</p>
